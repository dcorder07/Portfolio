# Portfolio
Conglomeration of classwork coding and personal projects. 

Calculating Accuracy through KNN: Class Project where I was given 2 data sets and performed KNN. Datasets can be given out upon request.

Calculating MSE and Cross Validation: Class Project where I was given 6 datasets and calculated MSE and performed Cross Validation with varying lambda values. Datasets can be given out upon request. 
Using the largest data set, I created 3 more training sets to aid in the accuracy of the models. 

AI Bias Image Generator, Contingency Tables, Race Pie Charts: All of these codes relate to a research project through Fordham on bias in AI generated images. I provide the code that I used to produce the images and a few of the visualizations.
