# Portfolio
Conglomeration of classwork coding and personal projects. 

Calculating Accuracy through KNN: Data Mining class project where I was given 2 data sets and performed KNN. Datasets can be given out upon request.

Calculating MSE and Cross Validation: Data Mining class project where I was given 6 datasets and calculated MSE and performed Cross Validation with varying lambda values. Datasets can be given out upon request. 
Using the largest data set, I created 3 more training sets to aid in the accuracy of the models. 

AI Bias Image Generator, Contingency Tables, Race Pie Charts: These scripts relate to a research project through Fordham on bias in AI generated images--they are for the image generation and a couple of the visualizations. 

SVM and Bayes Implementations: These are from a final project in my machine learning course. In one implementation I was allowed to use sklearn (Bayes) and in the other, I had to hard code the algorithm making improvements on what we had learned in class (SVM). Both use the same dataset, and SVM goes through different kernel and C values (we only went through basic SVM with linear and radial kernels in class).
