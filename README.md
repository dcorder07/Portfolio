# Portfolio
Conglomeration of classwork coding and personal projects. 

Calculating Accuracy through KNN Algorithm: Class Project where I was given 2 data sets and performed KNN. Datasets can be given out upon request.

Calculating MSE and Cross Validation: Class Project where I was given 6 datasets and calculated MSE and performed Cross Validation with varying lambda values. Datasets can be given out upon request. 
Using the largest data set, I created 3 more training sets to aid in the accuracy of the models.
